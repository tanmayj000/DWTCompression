The program is an implementation of the DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) Compression technique which is used for JPEG2000. 

To run the program: 
- The first parameter is the name of the input image rgb file. (file format is similar to previous
assignments).
- The second parameter n is an integral number from 0 to 9 that defines the low pass level to be used in your decoding. For a given n, this translates to using 2n low pass coefficients in rows and columns respectively to use in the decoding process . Additionally, n could also take a value of -1 to show progressive decoding.
